# kit

**kit** is a modern, minimal Git implementation built from scratch in Go. It provides both a command-line interface and a RESTful API for version control, making it a great learning resource and a foundation for custom workflows.

## What is kit?

kit is a simplified version control system inspired by Git. It lets you create repositories, stage and commit files, manage branches, and inspect historyâ€”all using Go. You can interact with kit via CLI or HTTP endpoints.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Repository**: Each user gets a workspace with a `.kit` directory storing objects, refs, and index.
- **Objects**: Files and directories are stored as compressed objects, similar to Git blobs and trees.
- **Index**: Tracks staged files before committing.
- **Commits**: Snapshots of the project, with author, message, and parent info.
- **Branches**: Multiple lines of development, switchable and creatable.

## Features

- Initialize a new repository
- Add files and folders to the index
- Commit changes with messages
- View commit logs
- Check repository status
- Restore files to previous states
- Create and checkout branches
- Reset branch to previous commit
- List branches and directories
- Web API for all major operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18+ installed

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kit.git
cd kit
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
go build -o kit ./cmd/kit
```

---

## Usage (CLI)

Initialize a new repository:

```bash
./kit init
```

Add files to the index:

```bash
./kit add <filename>
```

Commit changes:

```bash
./kit commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Check status:

```bash
./kit status
```

View logs:

```bash
./kit log
```

Create a branch:

```bash
./kit branch <branch_name>
```

Checkout a branch:

```bash
./kit checkout <branch_name>
```

## REST API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.
